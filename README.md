# Small Card Game

- Define a scriptable object with the characteristics of a pokemon/yugioh style card (at least attack, name, and a texture)
- Create 1 prefab that uses the scriptable object to populate the card
- Create 10 different card definitions and add a manager to your scene where you can get deck data from
- When starting the scene use random to populate 5 prefabs with 5 different scriptable objects
- Create a "randomize" button that when pressed will redefine the cards in the scene
